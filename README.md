# CrabLauncher 
**WIP Prototypo**

an open-source Minecraft launcher written in Rust.

## Usage
first you have to create a profile with a vaild version of Minecraft:
```
cargo run new [profile name] [version]
```
then you can run the profile:
```
cargo run run [profile name]
```

(Will make a new folder in the current dir called "launcher" for now)

(for now you need "java" in your PATH, some versions may require older java versions....)
